# The Rails

## 1. Rails is a framework, But it's a little different

Rails is a full featured framework, when you first use rails, you can even forget a little bit of ruby, just follow the rails way, although it's not good to learn rails like this. But so many people know ruby through rails, and so many people learn ruby through the source code of rails, it's on github, you can see it whenever you want, and you can see the tricks those the ruby master used. There are serveral parts of rails. They are **active support**, **action pack**, **active record**, **active model**, **action mailer**.These parts provide a MVC framework, and a mail framework, and extention of ruby language. except these, Rails includes any part of web development, including **tests**, **dependency management**, **generators**, **helpers**, and what's the best is the **plugin system**, by the plugin system, there are so many plugins(gems) which maybe you want to implement in your application. If you use rails, sometimes, if you are a little familiar with the community of ruby and rails, it will save you so much time. Maybe you will use the rails framework, and 10 gems(plugins), to finished a project in a 5 days, which could be finished in 3 weeks or even more in other languages. 

#### In ruby and rails community, we use resources those are already exsited, we don't reinvented the wheels, unless it must to be done.

## 2. People say Rails is good, compare to Java, PHP, C#, but it's not

Acturely this is what my boss said. Rails is a framework, the language is ruby, so we shouldn't compare rails to other languages, it not right. Can we compare rails to nodejs? No. NodeJs is just server side javascript

We can compare rails to struts, spring, hibernate, we don't compare one of them to rails, we compare the 3 to rails. Even though, it's not enough.

#### Please don't compare rails to other languages, it's meaningless.

## 3. Learn ruby first, or rails?

Several friends of mine asked me, to learn rails, do I need learn ruby or just start learning rails. According to me, starting learning rails, don't take too much time on ruby language itself at first, after you know something of rails, you will learn ruby language by yourself. Acturely rails makes ruby famous, not ruby lanuage itself. Learning rails could let you know how to use ruby language, and the power of the ruby language. I guess even the creator the ruby language doesn't realize the power of ruby language. 

#### So learning rails first, you can check the source code of rails, even you don't know the grammer of ruby language, but you learn ruby language by the source code, and you will know the top tricks of the ruby masters , and the best practice of ruby

## 4. What can I do by using Rails

Basically you can develop any kind of web application. You want to use ajax, OK! it's builtin. You want to send email, OK! it's builtin. You want reuse view code, to have layout and partials, OK! it's builtin. You know that the future is on the internet, the web. Frankly speaking, It's up to your imagination, because Rails itself includes servaral parts, it's also a framework. I mean the Rails framework is made by a framework. So you can develop so many plugins to reuse them in other applications. Acturely you don't need to, mainly what you want to do, other people have the same needs, they have already finished the work, for example, pagination, tag, cache, deploy, test. you just use it for free, you can give feedback if you want to.

#### Just start writing a small application, and you will know the things of rails. And you will not go back.

## 5. The best way to start to be a rails developer

* Read the guide on the official website of rails
* Start a rails application by following the instructions of the above guide
* Have an account of github
* Watch or fork repositories on github
* Read books about ruby and rails from pragmatic bookshelf
* Subscribe some rss of the websites which are about ruby or rails 
* Check the source of ruby-style-guide and rails-style-guide from github
* use rspec to test code

#### that's enough to start to be a rails developer, rails community is very open, you can ask any question whenever you want, stackoverflow.com is a website where you can ask this kind of questions.

## 6. To ruby language

Every rails master is a ruby master, rails is writen in ruby. To learn more , you should master the ruby language, you should read the "ruby programming", "metaprogramming ruby" book, it's from pragmatic bookshelf. And you should learn more from the source code of rails. Check more source code the well known applications or the well known ruby written project.

#### openmind is very important, because ruby is a dynamic language, it's very flex, don't think like java, you can what you want in ruby, programming in ruby is a game, it's interesting, it's funny.

## 7. What you will get when you working in ruby and rails

In other languages and framework, you are in a cave, but in ruby and rails, it's like a grassland, you can see as more as you can see, the limitation is just yourself. Take me as an example, through rails, I have known **NoSql Mongodb**, **NodeJS**, **Backbonejs**, **Auto deployment**, **TDD**, **BDD**, **Pair progamming**, **Functional Programming**, **Agile methodology**, **github**, although I am not a master in any of the above field, but now I am totally openminded, I know which technology I could use in my next project.

#### Learning rails is not only rails, you will learn a lot of things in softare industry.

## 8. Catch up with the community, try new things.

The community is very activity. You can see a lot of messages from internet everyday. You need follow some some people or some websites, try new things, and know it deeply. For example, you can install ruby in ubuntu just by the command `sudo apt-get install ruby`, actually, you should use **rvm**, it can manage all the ruby installations. Instead of deploying website to a server by copy paste, you can use capistrano to deploy application very easily and it's matianable. You can use **heroku** to deploy application for free at the very beginning. You can use **new relic** to analysis your application to find the bottleneck of the application. Because of the spirit of ruby and rails, there are a lot of new things, including platform, technology, resources, those you can use to improve yourself. I think people do not need to master all of these stuff at first, but knowing these could help people get a big picture of **morden developing technology**, the main idea is that using resources those are already exsited, and follow the best practice those are recommended by the community.

#### The best thing of the open source is that people can have the oppotunities to know what have made the magic. And it's not all, there is a big effect for people who are following the open source communities, they could be master in someday, because if nobody can provide new things for them, they will invent some for the community. Ruby and Rails are both opensourced, that makes the success. So you should join the community, to see what is happening, to know how to do it, and finally, you will be involved.

**This post is under versioned, I will add or modify something when I have new ideas, I hope this could help someone to really understand the ruby and rails. Although I am not a master in any field of ruby and rails. I think I have got the right way to work with them.**
